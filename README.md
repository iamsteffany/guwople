# GUWOPle

ðŸ”— https://steffnay.github.io/guwople

This is a word guessing game that selects from a lexicon composed of words from [the trap god Gucci Mane](https://twitter.com/gucci1017)'s track names. It's built on [Katherine Peterson](https://twitter.com/katherinecodes)'s [WordMaster](https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master).

## Rules

You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word.
Each guess can be any valid word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
